# Ada Roadmap

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to...

- Describe what a typical week at Ada is like
- Identify different parts of the space
- Predict how the structure of the course will change over time
This document is intended to give insight into what life will be like as a student at Ada Developers Academy.

## Program Structure

At Ada, we use the following terms to refer to students:

- **Cohort:** A group of 48 students who all begin at the same time. There are two cohorts per year, one beginning in August and one in February. Cohorts are referenced by numbers, as in `C8`.
- **Class:** Each cohort is divided into two classes of 24. The two classes are given complimentary names, like `Brackets` and `Parens`, `Octothorps` and `Ampersands`, or `Nodes` and `Edges`. Each class is led by two instructors.

Unlike a high-school or university program, our curriculum is not divided up into separate courses. Instead we have an integrated curriculum, where the two instructors for a class work together to present all content. That means you'll be with the same set of 24 people for the majority of your time over the next six months.

The exception to this pattern is CS Fundamentals, which is taught as a separate course on Thursday mornings with the entire cohort.

Feel free to browse through [the syllabus](./syllabus.md) for an overview of when various topics will be covered.

## The Ada Space

### TODO: image of floorplan

Ada is housed in an office building in downtown Seattle. There are 5 main areas that you'll need to pay attention to

- **Auditorium:** The large room in the northwest corner of the floor. This is where group lessons and CS Fundamentals are taught, and where many events will take place.
- **1-on-1 Rooms:** Four small rooms off the auditorium, these are where instructors hold 1-on-1s with students. You are welcome to use these rooms during project time, but the instructors reserve the right to kick you out if needed.
- **Classrooms:** These two medium-sized rooms along the west side of the building are where the majority of lectures and structured activities will take place. During project time these should be relatively quiet.
- **Living Room / Kitchen:** Space for you to eat lunch, work on group projects, and generally hang out. Please keep this space clean (especially the kitchen)!
- **Staff Rooms:** 4 offices on the south side of the building. These are reserved for staff use. As a student, please don't enter without permission - there might be personal information or half-graded papers lying around, and we want to avoid exposing this sensitive data.

**Restrooms** are located next to the elevators.

**Cubbies** for student use are scattered around the living room. Every student gets one. This is your space to store things overnight.

### Hours

On weekdays, staff will typically be at Ada from around 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM. It is not uncommon for students to stay later than this. If you're the last one out of the space, please ensure that all four external doors (auditorium, big classroom, cubby corridor, main entrance) are closed and locked.

On the weekends and after 6:00 PM on weekdays, the elevators will lock and require a key-card to operate. If there's already someone upstairs, one way to get around this is to use the delivator: the student who wants to come up calls and boards the delivator from the ground floor, and then another student summons it to the 10th floor.

If you need to be at Ada on the weekends or before staff arrive in the morning, talk to your instructor about checking out a key.

### Cleaning

**The Ada Space is small, and there are a lot of us here!** This means that keeping the space neat and orderly is everyone's responsibility.

Each week two students will be assigned to cleaning duty. These students have final responsibility for what the space looks like at the end of the week. However, **cleaning is everyone's job**.

Here are some specific things that everyone should do to help keep the space livable:
- **Clean your dishes** immediately after using; do not leave dirty dishes in the sink
- Pick up dirty dishes you see around the space and bring them to the kitchen. People tend to be especially bad about forgetting mugs in the auditorium.
- If the drying rack is full, **put away some dry dishes** before adding yours
- Keep the water heater in the kitchen stocked with water
- If you move furniture around, put it back in order when you're done
- **Erase your whiteboard** after you're done so it's clean for the next person. Do not assume that things you leave will remain on the board. If you need it take a picture.

## Typical Week

The first 5 months of Ada are the classroom portion, and will follow a more-or-less consistent pattern.

### TODO: image of calendar

Class begins sharply at 9:00 AM each morning. Please respect the time of your teachers and classmates by being on time. We recommend planning to arrive around 8:45 at the latest, to give yourself time to get settled.

Most weeks we will begin with a group lesson in the auditorium on Monday morning. This is where we'll introduce the main topics for the week, preview the schedule, and make any announcements that need to happen.

Lectures and structured activities tend to happen early in the day and early in the week. Typically Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings are the most lecture-heavy times. Afternoons are usually unstructured time to work on the week's project. You are expected to stay at Ada during this time.

On Thursday mornings, you will spend a short time in the regular classrooms, then go as a cohort to either CS Fundamentals or Diversity and Inclusion in the auditorium.

Starting in the third week, Thursday afternoons are "flex time". You should get an afternoon's worth of work done on the week's project, but it doesn't have to be at Ada, and it doesn't have to be right after lunch. This is a great time for you to schedule doctor or therapist appointments, pick your kids up from school, or do general life maintenance.

### Learning to Learn

A professional engineer rarely knows everything they need to complete a project. Part of your skill-set includes knowing what questions to ask and how to find the answers, whether from customers, co-workers, a reference book, or the internet. In other words, one of the most important things we can teach you is how to teach yourself.

As the cohort progresses, our curriculum will become less lecture-heavy and more project oriented. Our formal instruction will focus more and more on high-level concepts and vocabulary, but implementation details will be left up to you. Lessons will contain details you need to research on your own. Assignments may have ambiguous or incomplete instructions, or have multiple valid paths to completion. Instructors will give less direct support on projects.

This may be uncomfortable in the moment, especially if you haven't worked in this way before. However we find that this "letting go of the reigns" is essential to set students up for success on their capstone projects, in their internships, and in their future careers.

Besides, if things really go awry we'll still be here to help you clean up the mess.

### Projects

In addition to many smaller worksheets and exercises, each week will feature a large project for you to practice what you've learned. These projects will typically be introduced on Monday afternoon.

During the beginning of each of our 3 units the projects will be smaller and more targeted, and we'll sometimes have several small projects in the first week. By the end of the unit they will be broad in scope and require you to do independent research and design in order to complete them. In order to track this we have assigned each project a "stage" from 1 to 3, with 1 being heavily scaffolded and 3 being very open-ended. You can read more about the different stages [in this document](./rule-of-three.md).

Roughly half of our projects are pair projects. We structure our curriculum this way for two reasons:
- Modern software is written by teams of people, and proficiency with the tools and techniques used for collaborating on software is an essential outcome of our program
- Two students working together can learn from each other, and accomplish far more than either could alone

In addition about halfway through the curriculum there will be a two-week-long, four-person group project.

Unless otherwise stated, pair projects are due at 5:00 PM on Friday, and individual projects are due before class on the following Monday.

### Assessments

Most weeks include a digital assessment, which is given in-class on Friday afternoon. This tends to focus on vocabulary, high-level concepts, and reading code. The assessment has two main purposes:
- To help you find places where you may have missed something, so you know what to review before next week
- To help us identify trends across the class as a whole, so that we can adjust our instruction

Assessments can be big and scary. We believe that an intimidated student is not going to do as well, and that's why we don't tie weekly assessments to a grade. We ask that you take these assessments seriously, not for their own sake, but because they provide valuable insight into how the learning process is going.

### Lunch

Lunch is scheduled for one hour each day. The two classrooms have lunch at different times. One lunch is at 11:30, the other is at 12:30. On Thursday, the whole cohort will have lunch at 12:30.

You are welcome to use any of the kitchen equipment (microwaves, toaster oven, panini press, etc) for your lunch preparation. Please clean up after yourself.

You do not need to stay in the Ada space for lunch; there are many delicious and reasonably priced restaurants in short walking distance. Some staff favorites include:
- Uma's Lunch Box
- Joy Bento
- Pane Pane
- Great Northwest Soup Company
- Kigo
- Mee Sum

If your class has project time while the other class has lunch, please respect their lunch time! Living room tables should be prioritized for eating.

## Capstone Project

The final component of our six months together will be a month-long capstone project. This is the culmination of our philosophy of learning how to learn: you will pick a problem, teach yourself the technologies needed to address it, and build a project around it.

It's never too early to start thinking about ideas for capstone projects! There are two ways to approach this:
- Identify a problem you want to solve, and figure out how
- Find a technology or data-set you want to work with, and make up a project to do so

Here are some projects that have been successful in the past:
- A mobile app that uses data on construction projects in New York to provide walking directions that keep you dry under scaffolding
- A device that monitors the moisture levels of your houseplants and sends you a text when they need water
- A website that allows you to "wiki race", finding a path between two Wikipedia pages following the fewest number of links possible, and which runs the race itself and shows you the true shortest path
- A side-scrolling video game where the player must avoid obstacles and enemies to score points across multiple levels
- A mobile app allowing you to create a digital business card, which uses NFC to send cards to other people

You will get many more details about capstones as we get closer to them. For now, a good goal is to have two or three interesting ideas by about the fourth month of the program.

## Interviews and Internships

Please refer to your student handbook.

## Individual Support

### Project Feedback

You will receive feedback for almost every project you complete at Ada. Our goal is always to have this feedback to you within a week of the project's due date, though sometimes a big project will take a little longer.

Feedback consists of three pieces:
- A color
- A checklist of requirements
- Inline comments on your code

Here's what the colors mean:

Color  | Meaning                   | What we're seeing
---    | ---                       | ---
Green  | Meets or exceeds standard | All learning goals were met. The submission shows a reasonable level of polish. There are no major concerns.
Yellow | Approaches standard       | Most learning goals were met. Project may have been submitted with substantial bugs, or with some minor features missing. There's definitely room for improvement, but we're not _too_ concerned.
Red    | Not at standard           | One or more major learning goal was missed. Project is missing a big feature. Student probably needs extra support on this content.

The checklist of requirements is in the repo for each project in a file called `feedback.md`. If you missed a requirement, we'll usually include a note about what went wrong.

Inline comments will be about specific things we see as we read your code that aren't covered by the checklist.

### 1-on-1s

Each Ada student will have regular 1-on-1 meetings with their instructor. 1-on-1s are an important way for us to give you more targeted feedback, and provide an opportunity for you to bring up specific issues or questions that aren't appropriate in a larger group setting.

You will get more out of your 1-on-1 if you come prepared. Here are some questions to think about that may help guide the conversation:

- How did the most recent project go?
  - Think about both the code you wrote, and the process you followed.
  - If it was a pair project, how well did you work with your partner?
- How do you feel about the course in general? What is uncomfortable to you, and what is going well?
- Are there any life events coming in the next few weeks that we need to be aware of?
- What is a specific concept you would like to work on or piece of code you would like feedback on?
- Do you have an idea for a capstone project?
- Do you have any feedback for us?

Our goal is for each student to have a half-hour 1-on-1 with an instructor once every two weeks; in reality it's sometimes closer to once every 3 weeks, depending on what else is going on. 1-on-1s will begin regularly around week 3.

If something important comes up and you need to have a 1-on-1 sooner than the next regular one, please reach out to one of your instructors and we'll find a time to meet with you. Your instructor may also ask for a 1-on-1 on a tighter cadence if we think that's the best way to support your learning.

### Tutoring

Tutoring is described in [this document](./tutoring.md)
