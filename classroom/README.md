# The Mega Classroom Environment Summary

How are classrooms run at Ada?
- Where are class resources?
- Where is the class schedule?
- What are the systems of feedback?
- When will I meet with instructors?

## Schoology is where we keep Class Resources

We will use [Schoology](https://app.schoology.com/) to provide:

- Links to our classroom calendars and schedules
- The place where all assigned online quizzes, assessments, or reflections will take place
- Links to our classroom recordings
- Links to more resources we want to share


## We use Google Calendar to schedule Class and Homework

The schedule for classes will be set and displayed on our classroom Google Calendar.

Details for each lecture will be on individual events on the classroom Google Calendar. Please pay attention to all of the links, writing, details, and location!

You can find this Google Calendar through Schoology, though we recommend adding/subscribing to this calendar itself on your own personal Gmail account if you have one.

### We tend to schedule by Week units

Our curriculum is segmented into four units (Ruby, RoR, JS, Capstone), which are between 4-6 weeks each.

The curriculum schedule is set week-by-week, with a rolling release, as we reflect, adjust, and improve the schedule to respond to each cohort.

Although it's not 100% of the time, our most common pattern of the schedule has lessons throughout most of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, with a week-long project assigned on Monday and due either Friday or the following Monday.

If you're looking for a broad overview of our curriculum, you can find that either:
- [On our Syllabus Overview document](syllabus.md)
- On the Visual Timeline Overview document on Schoology

## Instructors Record Each Lesson

Most lessons will be recorded using our software named Panopto. The recording will be an audio and screen-capture recording. Each recording is then uploaded to the online Panopto folder. You can find this folder on Schoology.

An instructor may not record a lesson if the format feels inappropriate, such as a group activity.

## Systems of Feedback

### Projects, PSEs, CS Fun Assignments

In the classroom, you will get feedback on some specific projects, some specific exercises known as PSEs at Ada, and some CS Fun assignments. In most cases, the scale will be as such:

- **Green**
  - You have met or exceeded the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that the produced code shows enough understanding
- **Yellow**
  - You approached meeting the major learning goals for this project; to the grader, there is evidence that the produced code shows some understanding, and shows evidence that not all major learning goals were met
- **Red**
  - You did not meet the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that most major learning goals were not met, the progress on the project shows need for support on completion, quality, or both; the project is broken and not running


If you get a "Yellow" or "Red," depending on the context:
  - An instructor may check-in about concerns, gaps, what you would have done differently, and how to move forward
  - An instructor may ask for additional work on the project, depending on the missed goals
  - Ada staff may take any feedback/concerns/thoughts to come up with ideas for studying/support strategies

Check your current student handbook for details on systems in place for multiple yellow/red projects, PSEs, and CS Fun assignments.

### Feedback is part of Learning

We care about feedback being used to propel and inform learning, as a way of showing compassion and advocating for growth.

If you ever have any questions or would like clarity about feedback you receive on a project, the instructors and all of Ada Staff are excited to hear about it!

"Systems of Feedback" is extremely close to "Systems of Support," so stay on lookout for all of the other systems of support managed outside of the classroom at Ada, too.

## Individualized Meetings at Ada

### Ada Pods, Tutoring, TAs

These systems of support will be introduced outside of the classroom!

### Instructional Team One-on-One Meetings

It is expected that each student meets with the instructional team a few times during the classroom portion to talk about learning styles, questions on material, what's going on, what's going well, etc. These systems of support will be introduced over time.
